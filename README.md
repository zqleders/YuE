**YuE2 brings frontier song quality to music generation with an editable composition.** Give it lyrics and a style prompt: it writes a melody-and-chord plan, then realizes that plan as a complete song with vocals and accompaniment.

**[Try YuE2 online for free →](https://yue.noizai.net/)** · Hosted by NOIZ. No installation required.

<a id="music-arena"></a>

> **🎧 YuE2 needs your ears**
>
> We're running a public listening study comparing YuE2 with leading proprietary music generation systems. Listen to anonymous music clips and choose A, B, or a tie. Your honest feedback helps us understand how YuE2 sounds to real listeners.
>
> **[Listen & vote →](https://arena.3-148-255-99.sslip.io:8080)** · No account needed. Headphones recommended.

- **Frontier quality.** YuE2 is competitive with Suno v5/v6 on WildSongBench. YuE2 (best-of-8) achieves **6.9632 SongBench Avg**, the highest observed mean among all evaluated settings.
- **White-box music generation through symbolic planning.** Read, play, and change the composition before rendering it. Melody and chords become explicit controls that a person or an agent can inspect and edit.
- **Zero-shot covers and agentic editing.** Reimagine a transcribed song in a new style, or refine a song through a conversation about its score, arrangement, and lyrics—all with the same generation checkpoint.

[![YuE2 song quality and text alignment on WildSongBench](assets/frontier-teaser.png)](https://map-yue2.github.io/#model-overview)

*192 WildSongBench prompts. Both YuE2 settings use symbolic planning. Bo8 = best-of-8. The axes are normalized comparison indices; bubble area represents AudioBox production quality. [Scores and evaluation protocol](docs/benchmarks.md). [Vector PDF](assets/frontier-teaser.pdf) · [SVG](assets/frontier-teaser.svg).*

## Hear what you can make

| Create | Cover | Edit with an agent |
|---|---|---|
| Lyrics + style → score → full song | Source recording → melody score → a new interpretation | Musical feedback → score, style, or lyric revisions → a new recording |
| [Listen and inspect the score](https://map-yue2.github.io/#abc-cot-gen) | [Hear zero-shot covers](https://map-yue2.github.io/#cover) | [Follow an editing conversation](https://map-yue2.github.io/#agentic-music-editing) |

The agentic demo follows **The Last Train through 9 steps and 14 versions**, from Mandarin pop to English jazz with new harmony and a saxophone solo. Listen to each version and inspect its conversation, score, prompt, and lyrics.

## How it works

![YuE2 architecture: style and lyrics become an editable score, semantic music tokens, acoustic latents, and audio](assets/architecture.png)

One **AR–NAR Mixture-of-Transformers** backbone predicts the score and semantic tokens autoregressively, then generates acoustic latents with flow matching. A VAE decodes those latents into stereo audio. Creation, covering, and editing differ in where the score comes from: YuE2, a transcribed recording, or an edited composition.

The staged Python API exposes `plan()` → `generate_semantic()` → `synthesize()` → `decode()`. See the [generation guide](docs/generation.md) for exact-plan reuse and decoder selection.

## Quick start

**Linux · Python 3.12 · NVIDIA GPU with BF16 support and 24 GB VRAM.** YuE2 produces 48 kHz stereo audio without quantization. Model files download from Hugging Face on first use.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE.git
cd YuE
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install .
python examples/generate.py --output outputs/first-song
```

Open `outputs/first-song/audio.flac`. The output directory also retains the score, semantic tokens, acoustic latents, generation settings, and model identities.

The Python interface is equally short:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
from yue2 import YuE2Pipeline

request = json.loads(Path("examples/song.json").read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
with YuE2Pipeline.from_pretrained("m-a-p/YuE2-3B", device="cuda") as pipe:
    song = pipe(**request)
    song.save_artifacts("outputs/my-song")
    print(song.truncated)
```

| Setting | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `cot="full"` | Generate an editable melody-and-chord plan; the default for new songs |
| `cot="melody"` | Use a melody plan with free accompaniment; recommended for covers |
| `cot="off"` | Generate directly from lyrics and style |
| `abc=...` | Supply your own score in `full` or `melody` mode |

[Generation guide](docs/generation.md) · [Original example inputs](examples/README.md) · [v0.1.6 wheel archive](https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE/releases/download/yue2-v0.1.6/yue2_infer-0.1.6-py3-none-any.whl)

## Cover a song

Transcribe a source recording with **[🤗 SheetSage2](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/SheetSage2)**, review its melody ABC, and provide new lyrics or a target style. For covers, use **`cot="melody"` and a score without chord symbols** so the accompaniment can adapt to the new style.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from yue2 import YuE2Pipeline

with YuE2Pipeline.from_pretrained("m-a-p/YuE2-3B", device="cuda") as pipe:
    cover = pipe(
        style="English, jazz-funk, warm lead vocal, Rhodes, bass and drums",
        lyrics=Path("cover-lyrics.txt").read_text(encoding="utf-8"),
        abc=Path("cover-score/score.abc").read_text(encoding="utf-8"),
        cot="melody",
        seed=42,
    )
    cover.save_artifacts("outputs/cover")
```

SheetSage2 runs in a separate environment and loads its MERT2 encoder automatically. The [cover guide](docs/covers.md) gives the complete transcription and generation commands. An included [original melody example](examples/melody.abc) also lets you try score-conditioned generation immediately.

## Edit a composition

Export a plan, revise the musical details, and render the edited score:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
from yue2 import YuE2Pipeline

request = json.loads(Path("examples/song.json").read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
with YuE2Pipeline.from_pretrained("m-a-p/YuE2-3B", device="cuda") as pipe:
    plan = pipe.plan(**request)
    plan.save("outputs/plan")
```

Copy `outputs/plan/score.abc` to `edited.abc`, then ask an agent to change its harmony, melody, tempo, or form. Supply the edited file as a new score:

```bash
python examples/generate.py --request examples/song.json \
  --abc-file edited.abc --cot full --output outputs/edited
```

The editable score is the white-box interface: you can inspect the intended composition and intervene on it. Editing generates a new complete recording; it does not preserve the original waveform outside an edit. [Editing guide and a reproducible harmony example](docs/editing.md).

## Agent skill

The **[yue2-music skill](skills/yue2-music/SKILL.md)** teaches an agent how to generate songs, transcribe and cover recordings, edit ABC scores, check musical invariants, and organize listening comparisons. It includes portable helpers and references to the released model interfaces.

Use **`skills/yue2-music/` from this repository** with an agent that supports `SKILL.md` packages. Install it using your agent's skill-directory or import mechanism; the Python runtime is installed separately with `pip install .`. The earlier [v0.1.6 skill ZIP](https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE/releases/download/yue2-v0.1.6/yue2-music.zip) remains available under its bundled license.

Try a concrete request:

> Use the yue2-music skill to create an English piano-pop song. Keep the original audio and score. Make a second version with jazz harmony, preserve the vocal melody and lyric order, and give me both versions to compare.

† Publicly available model weights. All 17 evaluated settings are shown, sorted by SongBench Avg; bold values mark the best result in each column.

Both YuE2 settings use symbolic planning and the benchmark decoder, **YuE2-Vae-legacy**. Standard YuE2 selects from two candidates; best-of-8 selects from eight. Rankings vary by metric; the small gap between the highest means does not establish statistical significance. [Full results and selection protocols](docs/benchmarks.md).

**Zero-shot covers.** On 948 works, full-score YuE2 reaches **0.647 CLEWS mAP**, compared with **0.006 without a score**, while using the general generator without cover-specific fine-tuning. Source-identity preservation and target-style quality are measured separately; melody-only covers offer more freedom to change the arrangement. [Cover evaluation](docs/benchmarks.md#zero-shot-cover-generation).
